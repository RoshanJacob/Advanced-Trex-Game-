# Advanced Trex Game - Revised
This is a revised and remade version of google's trex game.
<br>
There are new characters, new obstacles and new features!
Travel through an endless (literally endless) path of fire and boulders while trying to collect as many coins as you can.

Thought that was it? It isn't!
While you play deep into the night, you may also notice that the background has changed with the day!
But, when you return in the morning, the game is no longer showing its secret.
